> *Maybe add another badge or link here to quickly navigate to the plugin store?*

> *tbh the Quality Gate badge is kinda useless in a public repository with little to no maintainers 'n stuff...*
> *But 2 green badges are better than one so why not :shrug:*
> 
> *SonarCloud also offers badges for other stuff like lines of code, duplicate code (%), and various code ratings they do*

# DDEV Intellij plugin

> *Short description of the plugin with maybe mentioning what DDEV is in an even shorter way.*


## Why do I need a plugin for that?

> *List of features, maybe with some additional details to link of the superiority the plugin provides*


## How do I use it?

> *Not sure if this is even needed but maybe this could be a place for screenshots?*


## Misc.

> *Some people have additional stuff at the end of their repo. Like mentioning their license or thanking people (like list notable contributors or in my case the Open Source License JetBrains provided to me etc.)*
> 
> *Not sure if we want those or what other sections might be nice*
